# PES University Admissions UI - Conversation Log

## Project Overview
This document contains all the prompts and responses from the development of the PES University admissions UI Angular application.

## Initial Setup and Project Structure
The project is an Angular-based admissions UI for PES University with the following structure:
- Main components: course-selection, basic-info, campus-info, header, home, important-dates, note, program-selection, progress-bar, syllabus, terms-and-condition, welcome, wellcome
- Services: navigate.service.ts, route-config.ts
- Assets: Various images including PES logos, JEE MAIN, KCET logos, and educational images

## Conversation Timeline

### 1. Initial Request
**User**: Help with Angular admissions UI issues related to homepage and course selection components, aiming to match a provided design image.

**Assistant Response**: Helped restructure the homepage, focusing on the `course-selection` component as the main page, and implemented a progress bar with steps like "Select Program," "Fill Basic Info," "Pay Fee," and "Complete Application."

### 2. Progress Bar Implementation
**User**: Wanted two progress bars with different contexts.

**Assistant Response**: Addressed by placing one progress bar on the homepage and another on the welcome page.

### 3. Animated Gradient Section
**User**: Requested an animated gradient section with specific colors.

**Assistant Response**: Implemented with CSS animations to create the desired visual effect.

### 4. Logo Replacement
**User**: Wanted the "JEE MAIN" and "KCET" logos replaced with images.

**Assistant Response**: Done by adding image tags and styling them appropriately.

### 5. Important Dates Component
**User**: Provided a large HTML snippet for the Important Dates page and asked to convert it into an Angular component with consistent header bars featuring the PES logo and a BACK button.

**Assistant Response**: Converted the Important Dates component to use structured data in TypeScript and dynamic HTML with Angular directives, styled it to match the uploaded image, and added a header with the logo and BACK button.

### 6. Syllabus Component
**User**: Requested the Syllabus page be similarly converted.

**Assistant Response**: Provided a TypeScript component, HTML template, and CSS styling for the Syllabus component, matching the design and including the header with logo and BACK button.

**User**: Provided a large HTML snippet for the Syllabus page.

**Assistant Response**: Converted into Angular-friendly markup, preserving all content and tables, and fixed Angular template parsing issues.

### 7. UI Adjustments
**User**: Requested adjustments to align elements, add borders to tables, and make progress bar steps always active.

**Assistant Response**: Made these changes accordingly to improve the visual consistency and user experience.

### 8. Additional Syllabus Features
**User**: Asked to include missing parts of the Syllabus page HTML (like scripts, footer, back-to-top button) into the Angular component.

**Assistant Response**: Acknowledged the request but the full integration of these parts into Angular components was not completed in the conversation.

## Key Technical Implementations
